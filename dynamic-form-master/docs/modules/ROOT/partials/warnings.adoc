[WARNING]
====
This module is at the [.d-post]#INCUBATOR# level.

Version 1.1.0 introduced UUID record identifier, making possible cross environment export/import without breaking references.

When moving from an older version of form module, or any version of poll module, several manual steps are required to migrate the data

* before upgrading the version, use export function on forms (polls) you would like to migrate
* drop all tables from the form database. If migrating from poll module, remove the `polls` database and create an empty one named `forms`
* after upgrading, re-import all the forms by cleaning first all the ids from the yaml files
